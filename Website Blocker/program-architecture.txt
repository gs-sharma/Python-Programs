host file - to block website we can tag the websites here

C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc - host file location in Windows
/etc/hosts - for mac & Linux

This program will add some lines in this file at some
specific time and remove them at other time

GOAL - modify at 8 am & remove at 8 pm

2 ways - open file using Python and add our lines
        and we use task-scheduler in win
        or cron in linux
        or any other task scheduler packages
        to schedule the task


        - Native solution - completly using python
          script will be running all the time
          memory will be used every time (though very small memory)


# we need admin access to modify the host file , open cmd as admin to run the file 
# chnage the extension of script to .pyw to that no cmd is prompted on running and you can use in directly by double click on it
